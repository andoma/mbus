Framing HDLC Lite

0x7e = Frame Delimiter
0x7d = Escape

Address nibble pair: [ssss_dddd]

Broadcast address: 0x7
Note that broadcast is never used as source address.
Thus, the address byte never needs to be HDLC escaped


Typical packet:

[Frame Delimiter] [Adddress] ... [CRC32] [Frame Delimiter]
                  |=== HDLC ESCAPED ===|
